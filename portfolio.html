            <p>This website was inspired by the fact that having a personal website is just satisfying, no matter how noob it would look like.</p>
            <p>Sitting down and designing this website involved quite some few hours to put up something simple that would be satisfying to look at. At the same, it took me some hours to be 
                satisfied with it because I wanted something perfect, but I have to admit, not everthing can be as perfect.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p>Coming up with the design was challenging at first, but I settled on something pretty decent.</p>
            <p>Hosting the website almost became a challenge because my previous project (the Blog project) wasn't successful.
                But it got hosted prettty smooth.
                 </p>
            <p>The greatest point here is working with some CSS can be so annoying. You get to solve one problem, and create two others ðŸ¤­. </p>
